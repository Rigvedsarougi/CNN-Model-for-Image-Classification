# CNN-Model-for-Image-Classification


This project demonstrates image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It includes steps for loading data, building the model, training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains training, validation, and test images.
- **notebooks/**: Contains a Jupyter notebook for data exploration.
- **src/**: Contains Python scripts for training and evaluating the model.
- **saved_models/**: Trained models are saved here.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required for the project.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run training: `python src/train.py`
3. Evaluate the model: `python src/evaluate.py`
4. Predict on new images: `python src/predict.py`
